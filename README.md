# 🧩 Redux Toolkit Counter App

This is my **first project using Redux Toolkit**.  
I built a simple **Counter Application** to understand how Redux Toolkit simplifies state management in React.

- State management using **Redux Toolkit**
- Store setup with `configureStore()`
- Slice creation using `createSlice()`
- Access state via `useSelector()`
- Dispatch actions via `useDispatch()`
- Clean UI design with CSS

## 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

- How to create and configure a Redux store

- How `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks connect components to Redux
- The benefits of Redux Toolkit over classic Redux setup
